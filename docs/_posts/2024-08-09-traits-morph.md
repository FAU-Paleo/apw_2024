Don't worry to much if it looks packed without much coffee breaks, they are designed within in each part to refresh your brain cells and move around a bit! 

## Content

Everything is available [here](https://github.com/TGuillerme/Morphological_traits).
But here's a run down of what we are going to cover:

#### Part 1:

Theory:

- morphological traits
- ordination: PCA and PCO (incl. distance matrices). 

Skills:

- reading trait data into R.
- ordinating data into R.

#### Part 2:

Theory:
- what is disparity?
- the multidimensional nightmare.
- reducing dimensionality
- mechanisms, processes and patterns in biology

Skills:

- an intro to the dispRity package
- measuring disparity
- reducing dimensionality
- choosing and testing disparity metrics.

#### Part 3:

Theory:

- testing hypotheses with disparity
- testing hypotheses through time
- simple disparity models
- phylogenetic comparative methods and disparity? [teaser for the next day]
- disparity of disparity analyses

Skills:

- comparing disparity between groups
- comparing disparity through time
- disparity-through-time (dtt) analyses
- disparity study design
